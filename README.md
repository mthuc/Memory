# Concentration

An Android game that allows users to play a game similar to "concentration."

## Game

The game will display a set of tiles on the screen. Each tile has a blank side and a side containing a word. Each word appears exactly twice in the tiles. Users turn over two tiles and if a match is found, the tiles remain displayed. Users will be able to choose games that display even numbers of tiles (between 4 and 20).

Scores will not persist between games.
